# INTRO

You've been given the task of creating a simple application with create/read/delete API requests for some fruit. Unfortunately, it looks like the backend developer who was in charge of creating the API was under an influence of psychedelic substances. Or just not very good at his job. The request to get a list of fruit doesn't make sense at all! We've reached out to the dev and asked him to fix the issue. His response was that it's not a bug but a feature. Ugh. Looks like you'll need to find a workaround and parse the request on your own.
